# ColladaMorphAdjuster REBOOTZZZ

## Installation

### Manually build and run
```sh
make build
```

You can then navigate to `/build/Release/ColladaMorphAdjuster` to run it.

### Auto build & installation
Also know as *EZ MODE*:

```sh
sudo make install
```

Installs the executable to `/usr/local/bin` (why sudo is required), which means you can just call `cma` from anywhere to run it.

## Usage:
```sh
cma collada_file [-o output_file]
```

or

```sh
cma -h
```
